After finishing my third quarter as a [CS 107](https://cs107.stanford.edu) course assistant (CA), I felt it would be appropriate to reflect upon my experiences and opportunities as a CA. I consider myself wonderfully fortunate to be a part of the CS 107 teaching staff and would like to detail my journey up to this point.

## What is CS 107?

CS 107 is Stanford University's introductory systems course and continuation of the introductory programming courses ([CS 106B](https://cs106b.stanford.edu)/[CS 106X](https://cs106x.stanford.edu)). The topics the class covers includes:

### Course Topics

- The C programming language
- Pointers vs. Arrays
- Generic/function pointers
- Integer types/bits/bit operators
- Floating point representation
- Introduction to Assembly language
- The build process (preprocessor, compilation, assembler, linking)
- Heap memory

The course in its current iteration/form consists of lectures, lab sections (one of which I lead as a CA) for students to get more hands on experience with the course material, six difficult programming assignments and three exams (two of which are midterms).

## What's the big deal with CS 107?

First of all, it's probably somewhat important to explain what _kind_ of course CS 107 is considered to be within the Stanford University community. For most computer science majors at Stanford, CS 107 is considered one of the largest and earliest hurtles in the Stanford CS core curriculum. One of the reasons I believe this course is difficult for a fair proportion of students who take it is that the class requires students 1) demonstrate a strong understanding of programming fundamentals and are able to apply those skills to the assignments and 2) are capable of quickly adapting to a new learn new concepts/ideas.

Ideally students would come into the course possessing both of these abilities, but often times, students have a rough mix of the two (sometimes students are great at programming, sometimes students are able to learn the new systems concepts).

It is my job as a CA to help assist students in getting through these particular hurtles by providing assistance in the form of office hours, labs and feedback in grading assignments.
