I like to think that I'm a relatively avid reader (when I have the time...). I generally keep track of my list of books to read on [Goodreads](https://www.goodreads.com), which is a pretty great website for keeping track of books that you want to read or have already read. You can see my personal Goodreads account [here](https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/11701087-john-louie).

Here is a list of books that I've read and recommend (along with an associated post for those books!... Once I get around to writing them...):

- [His Dark Materials]() trilogy by Philip Pullman
  - The Golden Compass
  - The Subtle Knife
  - The Amber Spyglass
- [1984]() by George Orwell
- [Their Eyes Were Watching God]() by Zora Neal Hurston
- [Flowers for Algernon]() by Daniel Keyes
- [Patriotism]() by Yukio Mishima 
- [The God of Small Things]() by Arundhati Roy
- [The Crucible]() by Arthur Miller
