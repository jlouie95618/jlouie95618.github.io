title: Hello World
---

Hello, and welcome to my website's first post! The purpose of this website is two-fold. 

Firstly, I'm hoping that this website will be a place for me to freely write about a variety of things that interest me; I'm hoping that explaining concepts through writing will help me gain a better understanding of those concepts.

Secondly, I'm hoping that this website can be a place of reference for individuals who share similar interests. I will strive to maintain a healthy abundance of citations. Additionally, as I learn things (and hopefully document my learning), I hope others can contribute to that process as well.

I'm hoping that the variety of topics I discuss/write about here has no limits, but here is a brief list of topics that I hope to learn/talk about at some point:

- Computer science
- Human biology
- The environmental
- Animals
- Book reflections
- Fitness (I'm particularly interested in climbing, but hopefully I'll talk about other stuff too!)
- Diet (specifically vegetarianism/veganism)

That's a brief list, so hopefully I'll be able to touch upon all the topics!
