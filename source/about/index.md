Hello, my name is John Louie and welcome to my personal website. In the past I've made numerous attempts at making a personal website. Most of the previous attempts have felt a little overly showy/obnoxious. Thus, I've attempted to keep things simple by just using a blog. However, we'll see how much of a "blog" this becomes. Hope you enjoy perusing this website! Here is a little more background information for the curious:

## Background

### TL;DR

I'm a Stanford University masters student studying Computer Science; I've worked at Stanford, Airtable, Microsoft and soon Amazon...

### Education

I am currently a graduate student studying Computer Science at [Stanford University](https://stanford.edu). You can see my résumé [here](resume.pdf). I am fascinated by the intersection between medicine/healthcare and technology and believe that it is one of the few frontiers that technology has yet to truly revolutionize. Owing to my interest in medicine and healthcare, as an undergraduate at Stanford, I took numerous classes in [Human Biology](https://humanbiology.stanford.edu) in addition to my computer science classes. 

I am also very interested in teaching and am currently a course assistant for [CS 107](http://cs107.stanford.edu), Stanford's introductory Systems course. Prior to joining the CS 107 teaching staff, which I've been a part of for three quarters, I was a course assistant for [CS 103](http://cs103.stanford.edu). During my undergraduate career at Stanford, I was an active [section leader](http://cs198.stanford.edu) for Stanford Univeristy's introductory computer sciences courses: [CS 106A](http://cs106a.stanford.edu), [CS 106B](http://cs106b.stanford.edu) and [CS 106X](http://cs106x.stanford.edu).

### Work Experience

In addition to school, during the summer of 2014, I conducted bioinformatics research in the [Ashley Lab](http://ashleylab.stanford.edu) at the Stanford University School of Medicine, and during the summer of 2015, I was a software engineering intern for the start up [Airtable](https://airtable.com). For the summer of 2016, I interned at Microsoft and for the summer of 2017 I'll be joining Amazon's AWS office in Palo Alto.


## Acknowledgments

Of course I'd be remiss if I failed to mention the amazing projects that have allowed me to create this:

1. Thank you to the creator of [Hexo](https://github.com/hexojs/hexo), [Tommy Chen](https://github.com/tommy351). Hexo is a framework for generating (static) blog websites. It uses a similar paradigm as other blogging frameworks like [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com), except that it is implemented with JavaScript. 
2. Thank you to the creator of the [Cactus Dark](https://github.com/probberechts/cactus-dark) theme, [Pieter Robberechts](https://github.com/probberechts). The theme is what you see here and I personally think that it is clean and very well thought out.
